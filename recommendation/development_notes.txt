Creating a recommendation engine to find event-attendees (read -- customers) that would have similar preferences. A number of models will be reviewed and added to this development branch.

- Rating Cluster model (proximity)
- Attribute Expansion (binary)
- Random Forest (decision path)
- Regression (probabilty likelihoods)
- k-nearest Neighbours

Thought process:

1. Regular request process PHP/SQL to make csv files of individual preferences and runs

2. This is downloaded to a queue process for Python script

3. Python reader converts the individuals preferences into a nested dictionary

4. Recommendation script runs and creates new outcomes 

5. New csv of results can be created and presented
